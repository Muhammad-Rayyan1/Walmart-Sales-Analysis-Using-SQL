# Walmart Data Analysis Project 🛒

Welcome to my Walmart Data Analysis project! 🚀 This project is part of my journey to learn SQL for data analysis. I've chosen Walmart's sales dataset as a real-world case study to develop and showcase my data analysis skills. The project includes exciting feature engineering to extract deeper insights. Let's dive in! 📊

## Objectives 🎯

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Sales Analysis**: To analyze sales trends, identify top-selling products and determine the influence of customer types and payment methods on sales.

2. **Product Analysis**: To explore product categories, evaluate the popularity of different payment methods and uncover the most successful product lines.

3. **Customer Analysis**: To understand customer demographics, purchase behavior and how different customer types and genders impact sales.

The project aims to extract valuable insights from the data that can be used for strategic decision-making and to gain a deeper understanding of Walmart's sales dynamics. 💡

## Feature Engineering 🛠️

In the process of this analysis, I've performed feature engineering to enrich the dataset with additional insights. Some of the engineered features include:

- `time_of_day`: To categorize sales into morning, afternoon and evening, providing insights into the best times for sales. ⌚
- `day_name`: To extract and categorize the day of the week for each transaction, aiding in understanding weekly sales patterns. 📆
- `month_name`: To extract and categorize the month for each transaction, helping identify monthly trends in sales and profit. 🗓️

These engineered features enhance the dataset, enabling more in-depth analysis and insightful visualizations. 📈

## Project Structure 📂

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `code`: Contains SQL scripts used for data extraction, transformation and analysis.
- `data`: Includes the Walmart dataset used for the analysis.
- `results`: Holds the results of the analysis, including generated reports and visualizations.
